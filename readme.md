### Team Proposal

Product / Idea: To Be Connected (A more inclusive design for wheelchair users)

### Scenario
Wheelchair users often face challenges when it comes to using public transportation. 
The lack of proper accessibility infrastructure and accommodations can make their journey risky.
Boarding buses or trains becomes an arduous task due to high steps or wide gap between trains and platforms that are not wheelchair-friendly. 

Normally, wheelchair users have to tell the staff at the customer service center and wait for the staff to bring their
portable ramp to the platform. This process usually takes 15 minutes or more. **Time Consuming**

Some of the wheelchair users reflected that **they don't want to seek help from others which make them look difference from 'normal' people**. Yet, they have to due to the design.
They become less-willing to travel out via public transportation because of the **sense of helpless, frustration and embarrassment**.

There are stations having a even **wider gap between the train and platform**. The below is one of the previous-happened accidents.

### Objectives
1. To reduce the height difference between platforms and trains.
2. To reduce the gap between platforms and trains.
3. **(Most Important)** To increase the independence of wheelchair users.
4. To encourage wheelchair users to travel out with public transportation.

### Early Designs
 
1. Yamp (Y-shape Ramp) - **Abandoned**
